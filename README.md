# MTWord (Memorize the Word)
<!-- A little info about your project and/ or overview that explains **what** the project is about. -->
MTWord stands for Memorize the Word and is a [Quizlet](https://quizlet.com/) clone 
but for Bible verses (using the [ESV](https://www.esv.org/) [English Standard Version])

## Motivation
<!-- A short description of the motivation behind the creation and maintenance of the project. This should explain **why** the project exists. -->
After a conversation with one of my friends, we realized how difficult 
it is to memorize Bible verses. I wanted to try to build something to aid 
making Bible verse sets and memorizing different verses. When making 
specific Quizlet sets for many verses, it can be tedious to individually 
make cards for a passage. This application seeks to address that struggle 
with allowing user to easily create many cards from one long passage reference.

<!-- ## Build status
Build status of continus integration i.e. travis, appveyor etc. Ex. -

## Tech/framework used

### Built with
<b>Backend:</b>
- [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/)
    * [Flask-Admin](https://flask-admin.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
    * [Flask-Bcrypt](https://flask-bcrypt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
    * [Flask-Bootstrap](https://pythonhosted.org/Flask-Bootstrap/)
    * [Flask-Mail](https://pythonhosted.org/Flask-Mail/)
    * [Flask-SQLAlchemy](https://flask-sqlalchemy.palletsprojects.com/en/2.x/)
    * [Flask-WTF](https://flask-wtf.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
- [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/guide/index.html)
    * Elasticsearch was used to index the sets by their name and description in order to easily search for different sets

<b>Frontend:</b>
- [jQuery](https://jquery.com/)
- [Lodash](https://lodash.com/)
    * Used to debounce API call necessary to get the verse from
- [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios)
    * Used to make AJAX requests


## Features
1. Auto-populate and Auto-correct implemented through using the ESV API

2. Searching through set names and set descriptions through Elasticsearch

3. Admin page accessible for the admin users to edit any of the users, sets, verses models

## How to use?
In order to host the project locally, follow these steps
```code
git clone https://github.com/d-lee84/MTWord.git
cd MTWord
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
flask run
```
Some features may not work locally because of API keys that are not available.

## Future directions
- Tests: Definitely want to make sure that all of my code is tested. Currently there is a problem running
    the tests because of the application context problem. 
- Helpful memorization features: Card matching, text matching, quiz features for the memorization aspect

## Code Example
Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out **how** your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise.

## Installation
Provide step by step series of examples and explanations about how to get a development env running.

## API Reference

Depending on the size of the project, if it is small and simple enough the reference docs can be added to the README. For medium size to larger projects it is important to at least provide a link to where the API reference docs live.

## Tests
Describe and show how to run the tests with code examples.

## Contribute

Let people know how they can contribute into your project. A [contributing guideline](https://github.com/zulip/zulip-electron/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) will be a big plus.
